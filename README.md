### How to Play the Game

* The game board consists of eight pairs of cards, each with a different type of food one on side
* On each turn, the player flips one card over to reveal its underlying image
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same image
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over. If the cards do not match, both cards return to their initial hidden state
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched

### Special Features

* The game features a timer to keep track the time the player takes to finish the game
* The player begins the game with a three star rating, but the number of stars decrease as more moves are used to finish the game
* When the game ends, a pop-up appears with the elapsed time, final star rating and play again button
